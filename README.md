# Simple-Angular-PHP-FE-BE-webapp
currently under development

this aims to document the flow of learning how to write a PHP API with a MongoDB, mainly to allow me to get back into PHP easily if I end up not using it for a long time
start in the learning PHP folder.
later on also the adition of learning Angular and creating a frontend
it's just a project to keep on the side to reference while trying the stuff in it in your own files

if you want to get more into the functions PHP has to offer, its best to just try a bunch of code challenges etc, since that is more on the logic side.
however as long as you have some experience with writing API's and Databases with other languages, this shouldn't be necessary
  
  basic_php_stuff.php explains how to install php and extensions, along with how to import them. further it just shows some quirks, didn't keep too much track of myself messing around trough their documentation
  main advice is, just browse around a bit, see if you find some interesting documents, and read the comments.
  the comments were a bit unusual for me at first, but find them suprisingly helpful and interesting now.
  
  basic_post&get_api.php just shows the basics for running a PHP server locally, accessing the variables etc
  
next go to the learning MongoDB folder
  
  basic_MongoDB_stuff.php mainly shows how to connect your database, how to get your standar crud operation etc, advice commenting certain steps out to see the progress from insertion to deletion
  everything uncommented just starts and ends with an emtpy collection
  
  basic_MongoDB_PHP_API folder contains a basic API that talks with a MongoDB, showing how to combine the two, and some interesting notes regarding what works and what doesn't
